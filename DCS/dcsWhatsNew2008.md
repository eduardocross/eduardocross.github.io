### Introduction
This document contains a list of what's new in this version. Those classes shown in red have been removed. 

### DBCS Support
DataGate now offers limited support for DBCS encoding, which enables DCS programs to handle Right-to-Left languages. For more information see the [ Bidirectional Support section of the DataGate Studio](http://devnet.asna.com/documentation/Help140/DgStudio/_dgHelpHome.html) help guide.

### Import/Export API
An asynchronous-processing-ready programming API has been added which supports importing and exporting either CSV and XML records. It operates through four WPF-based controls:1. Export to CSV
2. Export to XML
3. Import from CSV
4. Import from XML

Each of these controls has options that allow developers to export records in RRN order, Key order, or sorted by a query.

### Mapping Options
DataGate now supports mapping records by index as well as by name. This feature is accessible via the command dialog.
