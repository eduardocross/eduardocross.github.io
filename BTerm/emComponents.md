# Browser Terminal Components
ASNA Browser Terminal is composed of several crucial components, most of which should not be altered by the user or administrator.

- [SignOn.aspx](signonscreen.html) - This page composes the sign-on screen users will encounter when logging into your system.
- [Web.Config](WebConfigAppSettings.html) - This file controls much of the function of the Terminal Emulator.
- [WingsJob](WingsJob.html) - This file influences many low-level functions of the Terminal Emulator, and should generally be left alone.
