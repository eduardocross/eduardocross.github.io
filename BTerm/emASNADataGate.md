# ASNA DataGate's Role in ASNA Browser Terminal
This topic describes ASNA DataGate, a software product included with and required by BTerm, and how BTerm uses it. 

ASNA's DataGate is software for the IBM i that allows BTerm (and other installed ASNA products) on a Windows platform to interact with the programs and files on the IBM i. In BTerm, it serves as middleware that translates instructions from .aspx pages into commands for the IBM i. It handles this communication through TCP/IP, enabled by the IBM i-supplied telnet utilities. 

BTerm requires an up to date version of DataGate for IBM i be installed on the IBM i. The latest version can be downloaded from here: http://devnet.asna.com/downloads/Pages/ASNA112ProductSuite.aspx 

Using DataGate to run BTerm does not require a separate DataGate license. Running other programs may require additional licensing.
