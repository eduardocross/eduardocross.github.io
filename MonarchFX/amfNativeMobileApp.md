# The Native Phone App
Introduced alongside version 6.2, **ASNA Go** is a native application for iOS and Android that allows the developer to use features of the mobile platform unavailable to standard browsers. This allows Mobile RPG developers to make use of restricted hardware features without having to develop complete native apps for themselves (a complicated process requiring specialized programming languages and standards).

ASNA Go can improve the overall user experience in a few ways:
- Apps can be run in full screen, with no browser 
						buttons; allowing your Mobile RPG app the maximum 
						possible amount of screen real estate.
- Device orientations can easily be locked, making 
						formatting and optimization of your app that much 
						simpler.
- ASNA Go saves the state of your app: if users follow 
						links out into the wider web, they can return to their 
						place in the Mobile RPG app by merely tapping the icon 
						(barring timeouts).

ASNA Go also allows developers to make use of the following ASNA Mobile Support control:
- [Barcode Controls](amfUnderstandingBarcodes.html)

Note: ASNA Go is *optional* . Mobile RPG apps can be used without downloading or installing it, and many situations preclude its use (for example, organizations that use Windows or Blackberry devices exclusively). 

### Using ASNA Go
1. ASNA Go is available for download at
<li> **iOS &#8211;**  the Apple app store 
					(look for the ASNA Go logo; there are a lot of apps named 
					Go).
2. **Android &#8211;**  the Google Play Android 
						marketplace (again, look for the ASNA Go logo; it's a 
						fairly common name).

</li>
3. It must be downloaded onto each device that requires the 
					expanded functionality.
4. Once 
					downloaded, it works like a 
					web browser; just enter the web address of the Mobile RPG 
					App, press 
					Go, and it will take you there.
5. To quit, close ASNA Go like any other app.

### Limitations of ASNA Go
- iOS/Android native &#8211;  ASNA Go is not currently available on other mobile operating systems (Windows Phone, Blackberry).
- **iOS limitations** 
						<ul>
							<li>iOS 6 minimum &#8211; ASNA Go is not supported by earlier versions 
							of iOS.

							the iPhone, other iOS platforms and form factors may result in less than ideal presentation.

</li>
					<li> **Android limitations**

								and later. Limited support may be available on Android 2.3 (Gingerbread), but older versions are not supported.

							and tablets) are supported, but more specialized
