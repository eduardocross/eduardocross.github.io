** The <span class="hcp1">PrintQuality</span> enumeration is no longer supported. ** 

Use the PrintTrueType enumeration. Also please note that not all of the possible values for this enumeration may be valid for your printer. Each printer has a limited set of acceptable values. It is up to the programmer to select the value adequate to the actual printer used to render the output of the print file.
