# Licensing DataGate&#174; for SQL Server
The steps below will describe how to use ASNA Registration Assistant to register DataGate&#174; 16.0 for SQL Server, DataGate&#174; 11x for Windows Servers and Desktops, and DataGate&#174; 11x WebPak. Please refer to the appropriate Readme for instructions on licensing other ASNA products. 

If you purchased licenses for multiple ASNA products, you will need to repeat these steps for each product you're licensing. For example, you would perform these steps for entering a license key for **DataGate&#174; 16.0 for SQL Server** , then again for **DataGate&#174; 16.0 for Windows Servers and Desktops** , then again for **DataGate&#174; 16.0 WebPak** ; entering the appropriate license key for each product. 

1. Before the expiration of your 
					  temporary license, if applicable, contact **ASNA**  to 
					  obtain a License Key(s) for the desired component(s) as 
					  described above.
2. Once you are given the License 
					  Key(s), enter the License Key(s) within **ASNA 
					  Registration Assistant** . Start ASNA Registration 
					  Assistant by selecting **Start - ASNA Product Suite for 
					  Visual Studio - ASNA Registration Assistant** . <br /><br />
					  You can also select **ASNA Registration Assistant.exe**  
					  from the ..\Program Files\Common Files\Asna Shared folder.
					  <br /><br />
3. Select the **Product**  on the 
					  left that you are licensing.
4. Enter the appropriate **License 
					  Key**  (for the product you are currently licensing) that 
					  you received from ASNA, along with the other pertinent 
					  information; such as Name, Company, Users, and License 
					  Period.
5. Select the **Register Product**  
					  button to accept the information, the **Exit**  button 
					  to close Registration Assistant, or the **Help**  button 
					  to get help on ASNA Registration Assistant.
6. Continue with these steps for each 
					  ASNA product you are licensing.
