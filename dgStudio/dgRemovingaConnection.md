A database connection may be removed from the Connections collection when it is no longer needed. Note that removing a connection based on a database name does not remove the database name. To remove a database name, you must delete it from the Local Database Names collection.

#### To Delete an Existing Database Connection

1. Select **DataGate Explorer**  from the **DataGate**  menu. The DataGate Explorer tool
				window will display.
2. Select the connection node to delete under the Connections node in Datagate Explorer.
3. Select the **Delete**  command on the Edit menu. Alternatively, press the Del key or
				right-click the connection node and select the **Delete**  command.
4. A message box appears, prompting you to confirm the delete operation.
5. Click the **OK**  button, the dialog will close and the connection will 
				be deleted. You may click **Cancel**  to discard your changes and close the dialog.
