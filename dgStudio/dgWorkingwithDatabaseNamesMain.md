The DataGate Explorer tool allows you to add, change, or delete a database name. A database name is the **identifier** you use in your applications to refer to a particular database. This name encapsulates not only the server and label of the database, but also the access method, and the account to use on the server.

A database must be "Named" in order to be accessed and used in applications. Naming a database creates a logical name on your local computer that points to a database on a local or remote server. You can add multiple logical database names that point to the same database.

Database names can also be used in DataGate Explorer to create database connections. Database connections allow you to perform database management tasks and to design database and print files in DataGate projects.

DataGate Explorer displays all database names registered on the local computer under the Local Database Names node, as shown below.

You have two ways of creating database names with DataGate Studio.

- **Add a New Database Name**  Command - This DataGate Explorer command (found in the icon bar at the top of DG Explorer,
				as well as by 
					right-clicking the Database Names item in the treeview) displays a dialog
					for entering database name parameters.
- **Database Wizard**  Command - This DataGate menu command starts a wizard-style applet for
				creating database names, and optionally, a new server database and label.

Once a database name has been created, you can easily modify its identifier and properties in DataGate Explorer.

- Use the **Edit Properties**  command on an existing database name to modify the
					connection properties of the database name.
- Use the **Rename**  command on an existing database name to change its identifier.
