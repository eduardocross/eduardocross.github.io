		  <br />The ASNA DataGate database access platform has been used by Visual 
		  RPG developers for many years to create useful Windows data applications. 
		  As development goalschanged, so did DataGate; implementing one of the first managed-code 
		  .NET data providers for both the iSeries and SQL Server. DataGate 
		  Studio leverages the power of the DataGate .NET provider, and the 
		  strong foundation of Microsoft Visual Studio to implement the tools 
		  required by developers and administrators to design, maintain, and 
		  manage the database. DataGate Studio is more than just a database 
		  manager. 

It contains a suite of utilities that can be tailored to a particular usage:

- Developers will appreciate the project system 
		 		 and the Database and Print FileDesigners.
- Database administrators can use the various tools for moving, copying, 
		  		deleting, viewing, modifying, exporting, and importing the data.
- Solutions technicians can easily deploy and configure databases and 
		  		connections.

#### Primary Features

- **Visual Studio Integration -** DataGate Studio runs in the Visual Studio Shell; the
					same integrated development environment engine used by Visual RPG, Visual Basic,
					and Visual C#. The common IDE offers benefits such as Solution Explorer support,
					document window integration, output window integration, property window support,
					shortcut keys and menus, and many others.
- **.NET and XML -** DataGate Studio is implemented using 100% .NET managed code.
					The DataGate .NET data provider, which is the same library used by Visual RPG
					applications, expresses data and metadata with XML documents. This allows
					DataGate Studio to offer enhanced views of data and file definitions.
- **File Definition Projects -** With DataGate Studio™s file designers and project system,
					developers can design database and print files, and save and manipulate the
					definitions as source code. This offers many benefits, including off-line development
					and source code control.
- **Data Viewing/Editing -** View and edit data using two different tools: a singlerecord
					viewer, or a grid-based, multi-record viewer.
- **Import/Export -** Export a single member, or one or more entire libraries to a file on
					the local computer. Import the contents of that file to another database server, or
					another location on the same server. Import/export supports both database schema
					and data.
- **Traditional Tools -** Many of the same commands and applets DataGate users
					became familiar with in ASNA Database Manager are fully implemented or enhanced
					in DataGate Studio, including Copy Data, Copy Logical, and Work with Databases.
- **Active Dictionary Access -** Browse and modify all aspects of the current structure
					of the database, including libraries, files, data areas, and members using DataGate
					Explorer.
- **File Designers -** Design .NET print files with a WYSIWYG designer hosted by the
					IDE. Design database files with an all-new graphical designer. Both designers offer
					a code view, which allow you to edit the underlying XML document based definitions,
					independent of the database. Further, the XML schema for file definitions is installed
					with DataGate Studio, facilitating IntelliSense® and syntax checking features when
					using the XML editor view. DataGate Explorer commands also let you examine and
					modify the definitions of existing files using the Designer.
- **Database Naming and Labeling -** Browse, label, and configure connections to the
					database for every possible DataGate application deployment scenario.
