This release of DataGate for .NET will feature a new library interface, which is designed to allow ASNA and its users create custom server text translators, by implementing subclasses of the .NET Framework's **System.Text.Encoding** class and associated classes. Currently, DataGate relies on the database server to provide a reasonable translation of character fields to and from Unicode.

In extraordinary cases, such as iSeries-based bidirectional text, the database server is not able to evoke reliable translations. For these cases, the server text translation interfaces provide an alternative, client-based, plug-in capability to replace the standard DataGate Unicode translation.

These custom text translators will be loaded, via application configuration, by the **ASNA.DataGate.Client** library. Users will be able to associate a text encoding name, and other custom translator settings, with a registered [database name¬ù](dgWorkingwithDatabaseNamesMain.html), or SourceProfile object. DataGate Studio will support the configuration of the custom translator in the [Advanced connections properties](dgAdvancedConnectionProperties.html) dialog of the DataGate Explorer tool. The section on [Implementing and Configuring an Alternate Server Text Translation Provider](dgAlternateServerTextTranslationProvider.html) explains the interface in full detail.
