ASNA Research and Development is releasing an enhancement to DataGate support for iSeries databases. This enhancement involves text stored on the iSeries containing characters normally read from right-to-left (unlike English text, which is normally read from left-to-right, like the text in this sentence). This support will only be accessible through the .NET DataGate client.
