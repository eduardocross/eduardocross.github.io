Before you can access a DataGate database in an AVR or Monarch application, you must create a database name to refer to the database programmatically. You can create database names in DataGate Studio with the **Add New Database Name** command, as explained below.

You can also easily create database names by selecting Database **Wizard** from the DataGate menu.

#### To Create a New Database Name

1. Select **DataGate Explorer**  from the **DataGate**  menu. The DataGate Explorer tool
				window will display.
2. Click the **Add New Database Name**  button on the right side of the toolbar at the top of DataGate
				Explorer window (or alternately, right-click the **Local Database Names**  node and select **Add New
				New Database name**  on the context menu). The New Database Name dialog is displayed, as
				shown below.

3. Select primary parameters for the database name, as explained [here.](dgDatabaseNameParameters.html)
4. After clicking **OK** , the dialog will close and the identifier of the new database name
				will be selected in edit-mode, under Local Database Names in DataGate Explorer.
				Change the default, "New Database Name", to the identifier you wish to refer to the
				database name with.

Enter a "Name" to call the database on your computer. This is the **identifier** you will use to refer to the database in your applications.
