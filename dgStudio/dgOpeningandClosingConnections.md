Before management tasks can be performed with a DataGate Explorer connection, the connection must be opened. Likewise, when your tasks are accomplished, the connection can be closed to free database resources.

The current open status of a connection is displayed by the connection node's icon.

#### To Open a Connection

1. Select **DataGate Explorer**  from the **DataGate**  menu. The DataGate Explorer tool
				window will display.
2. Expand the Connections node to reveal the connections available.
3. Find the connection to open, and then click the Expand widget next to the node.
				DataGate Explorer will open the connection and if successful, display the database
				libraries, as shown below.

Alternatively, you can right-click on a Database Name in DataGate Explorer and select Open Connection as described under [Creating a Connection](dgCreatingNewConnection.html)

				menu. Select Close Connection to close the connection.
